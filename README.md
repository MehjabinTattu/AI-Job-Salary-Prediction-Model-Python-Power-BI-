# 🤖 AI Job Salary Prediction Model (Python + Power BI)

## 🧠 Objective
Develop a predictive model to estimate salaries for AI-related roles based on job title, experience level, company size, and location.  
Combine machine learning analysis in **Python** with an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for visualization and insights.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Power BI, SQL

## 🚀 Key Steps
- Cleaned and preprocessed job market and salary datasets  
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends by region, job role, and experience level  
- Encoded categorical features and scaled numerical variables  
- Trained and evaluated **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** models  
- Integrated model predictions into **Power BI** for dynamic salary visualization and benchmarking  
- Created filters for **experience level, region, and role type** in Power BI

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **R² = 0.87** for salary prediction accuracy  
- Identified top factors influencing salary: experience level, company size, and region  
- Delivered an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for salary benchmarking across AI roles
